## Synopsis

This Catalog App is the fulfillment of the third project in Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree. The requirements for which are to build a cataloging application using flask and sqlalchemy as a backend and using html and css (bootstrap) as a front. The app is to take user authentication and keep data safe; allowing only authorized users to perform CRUD operations on data for which they are the creators. This does all that and **more**.

## Explanation

The frontend is powered by AngularJS and interations with the backend are done through json, with authentication being the exception as it uses Flask cookies. All requests for data are done through the `/api/` endpoints which are handled by Angular, and consequently, most pages(partials) are request directly by Angular. For the pages that require rendering, Flask handles the request. 
An Atoms RSS feed can be reached at `/api/recent.atom`.

## Installation

All depencies for the frontend are either contained within the repo or have links to their CDN. For the backend, you must first install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). Once these requirments are fulfilled, open terminal. From terminal, `cd` into Catalog Apps directory:
```sh
$ cd /catalog-app-master
```
Run vagrant up and wait for the virtual environment to be installed:
```sh
$ vagrant up
```
SSH into the vagrant environment:
```sh
$ vagrant ssh
```
Once in, cd to host folder:
```sh
$ cd ../../vagrant
```
Then run application.py to start the server:
```sh
$ python application.py
```
After this, the application is ready to use. In your browser, go to `localhost:8000`

## ABOUT
This is the individual project's VPS set up. The main module can be found [here][1].
Write script in this file as if they were being run as root and place production specific files in this directory. They can be mutated with data from the main module and then moved to the parent directory, or other directory as needed by this project.

Remember, the commands in this file should be specific to this project and more global configurations should be placed in the main VPS set up files.
